Instructions:

The player will begin at a start screen. They can then choose to play the game py selecting start.
The main objective of the game is to dress up a character with all the options available. This is possible
by selecting from the left-side menu or by clicking directly on the character itself for a closer look
at that particular body part. The player can choose to go back to the main selection menu by clicking the
back button when in the zoomed-in state. Once the player is done, they can finish their build and either
exit or restart the game by clicking the appropriate buttons.
